### 1. [Welcome](https://github.com/moscarelloscott/moscarelloscott/blob/main/CSE212.md) 2. [stack](https://github.com/moscarelloscott/moscarelloscott/blob/main/stack.md)  4. [Binary Tree](https://github.com/moscarelloscott/moscarelloscott/blob/main/binarytree.md)
    
### 3. [linked list](https://github.com/moscarelloscott/moscarelloscott/blob/main/linkedlist.md)
    *linked list Introduction
         Linked list are a linear structure that forms a chain, unlike the stack method 
         any linked list node can be accessed without the need to pop or remove the last node inputted
         this makes the linked list faster than stack and pehaps better for larger more complexed databases.
         
         Each node will have two seperate values, the value which hold the array object and the second part is the pointer which points to the next node within the linked list.
    *linked list Example code
    *linked list Problem to solve
