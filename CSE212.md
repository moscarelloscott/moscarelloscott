# Python CSE212 Final Project - Outline 
## *Python Tutorial*

### 1. [Welcome](https://github.com/moscarelloscott/moscarelloscott/blob/main/CSE212.md)
    *Introduction
         In this tutorial we will take a look at three different methods of storing data in Python.
         Before we jump into these methods we should look at the definition of nodes
         Nodes are a data structure that stores information(any type) and are used in all three of 
         the methods we will cover; stacks, linked list and binary trees. 
         I find it easier to think of a node as a container with one object inside it.
         Each method uses nodes differently, to simplify it for now...
         Stacks and linked list are a linear structure whereas a binary tree is non-linear.
