# 4. [Binary Tree]

    Unlike the stack and Linked List, Binary Trees are Non-Linear, 
    they still use Nodes like the Linked List but do not have a head or tail, 
    instead the tree will have a single root at the top and children or leaves 
    at the bottom of the tree.

    In the example above #1 is a parent of #2 and # 2 is the child of #1, however # 2 is also the parent of #3
